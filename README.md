## Logo and Favicon

Drop your logo and favicon into `docs/assets/images/`:

- `docs/assets/images/logo.png` — site logo (shown in top-left nav bar), recommended 48×48px
- `docs/assets/images/favicon.png` — browser tab icon, recommended 32×32px

Then uncomment these two lines in `mkdocs.yml`:
```yaml
logo: assets/images/logo.png
favicon: assets/images/favicon.png
```
And remove (or comment out) the `icon: logo:` line below them.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are referenced as placeholders throughout the docs.
Drop your real screenshots into `docs/assets/screenshots/` matching the filenames used in the markdown files.

All installation screenshots go in: `docs/assets/screenshots/installation/`

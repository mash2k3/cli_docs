# Configuration

After completing the onboarding wizard, all settings are available in the **Settings** page. Settings are organised into tabs — each tab covers a logical group of functionality.

|---|---|
| [UI Settings](ui-settings.md) | Theme, time format, compact view, logo, user system |

## Finding settings quickly

The Settings page has a live search bar at the top. Start typing any setting name and it will instantly filter and jump you directly to the relevant field — no need to browse through tabs manually.

## How settings work

- Changes are applied immediately when you click **Save**
- Sensitive fields (API keys, tokens) are masked after saving
- Some settings require a program restart to take effect — these are labelled accordingly
- Settings are stored in `config/settings.json` inside your mounted config volume

!!! tip "Onboarding vs Settings"
    The onboarding wizard only covers the minimum required settings. Everything else — notifications, advanced scraping, overlays, AI Butler — is configured through the Settings page after setup.

## Next steps

Start with [Required Settings](required.md) to verify your core connections, then work through [Content Sources](content-sources.md) and [Scrapers](scrapers.md) to start getting content.

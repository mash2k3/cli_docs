## Plex / Jellyfin

=== "Plex"

    | Setting | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Plex URL** | Full URL to your Plex server, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:32400` |
    | **Plex Token** | Your Plex authentication token |
    | **Shows Libraries** | Comma-separated list of your TV library names or IDs, e.g. `TV Shows,Anime` or `2,4` |
    | **Movie Libraries** | Comma-separated list of your movie library names or IDs, e.g. `Movies,4K Movies` or `1,3` |

    !!! tip "Using library IDs"
        You can use either the library name or its numeric ID. To find the ID, open your Plex library in the browser — the `source=` value at the end of the URL is the library ID. For example, `source=1` means the library ID is `1`.

    ### Finding your Plex token

    1. Open [Plex Web](https://app.plex.tv) and browse to any media item
    2. Click the **...** menu → **Get Info** → **View XML**
    3. In the URL bar, copy the value after `X-Plex-Token=`

=== "Jellyfin / Emby"

    !!! warning "Symlink mode required"
        Jellyfin and Emby do not support the Plex API. You must use **Symlinked/Local** file management mode. See [File Management](#file-management) below.

    | Setting | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Jellyfin/Emby URL** | Full URL to your Jellyfin/Emby server, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8096` |
    | **Jellyfin/Emby Token** | Your Jellyfin/Emby API token |
    | **Shows Libraries** | Comma-separated list of your TV library names |
    | **Movie Libraries** | Comma-separated list of your movie library names |

    ### Getting your Jellyfin API key

    1. In Jellyfin, go to **Dashboard → API Keys**
    2. Click **+** to create a new key
    3. Name it `cli_debrid` and copy the generated key

## File Management

This is one of the most important settings.

=== "Plex mode"

    cli_debrid uses the Plex API to track which files are in your library. Plex reads directly from your debrid mount.

    - Plex only — does not work with Jellyfin or Emby
    - No symlinks needed
    - Plex must be able to read the mount path

    **Mounted File Location:** Set to your debrid mount path, e.g.:

    - Zurg: `/mnt/zurg/__all__`
    - Decypharr: `/mnt/decypharr/__all__`

=== "Symlink mode"

    cli_debrid creates symlinks from the mount into an organised folder structure. Your media server scans the symlink folder.

    - Works with Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby
    - Required for Jellyfin and Emby
    - Required on Windows (use Jellyfin — Plex doesn't support symlinks on Windows)

    | Field | Value |
    |---|---|
    | **Original files path** | Your debrid mount path (e.g. `/mnt/zurg/__all__` for Zurg, `/mnt/decypharr/__all__` for Decypharr) |
    | **Symlinked files path** | Where organised symlinks go, e.g. `/mnt/symlinks` |

    !!! warning "Volume mounts must match exactly"
        In symlink mode, cli_debrid creates symlinks that point to files inside the debrid mount. For these symlinks to resolve correctly, **both cli_debrid and your media server containers must mount the debrid storage and symlink folder at identical paths**.

        For example, if cli_debrid has:
        ```
        /mnt/remotes/zurg  →  /media/mount   (debrid mount)
        /mnt/symlinks      →  /mnt/symlinked  (symlink folder)
        ```
        Then Plex/Jellyfin/Emby must have the exact same mappings:
        ```
        /mnt/remotes/zurg  →  /media/mount   (debrid mount)
        /mnt/symlinks      →  /mnt/symlinked  (symlink folder)
        ```
        If the paths differ between containers, symlinks will appear as broken files in your media server.

!!! warning "Symlinked/Local mode on Windows"
    Windows requires Developer Mode enabled for symlinks. Plex does NOT support symlinks on Windows — use Jellyfin instead.

# Database Browser

The Database Browser lets you view, filter, sort, and take actions on every item in your media library directly — without needing a separate SQLite tool. It's the go-to place for bulk operations and inspecting item states.

## Views

The Database Browser has two views toggled from the header:

**Table view** — the default. Full filtering, sorting, column customisation, and bulk actions.

**Visual Grid view** — poster card layout. Search by title and scroll through your library visually. Cards show poster, title, year, and type.

## Stats panel

Click the chart icon to expand the Stats panel showing total Movies, Shows, and Episodes in your database.

## Content type & alphabet filters

| Filter | Options |
|---|---|
| **Content type** | All, Movies, Episodes |
| **Alphabet** | All, #, A–Z — jump to items starting with that letter |

---

## Advanced filtering

Click **Add Filter** to build multi-condition filters. Quick filter buttons for common columns (Title, State, Version, IMDB ID, Type) are also available.

| Filter option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Column** | Any column in the table |
| **Operator** | contains, equals, greater than, less than, etc. |
| **Value** | Text input or dropdown (pre-populated for State, Type, Version, Content Source, Upgraded, Early Release) |
| **Logic** | AND (all filters must match) or OR (any filter matches) |

---

## Sorting

Use the **Sort Column** dropdown and **Ascending / Descending** toggle. Click **Apply** to update results.

---

## Column customisation

Click **Select Columns to Display** to open the column manager:

- Move columns between **Available** and **Selected** lists
- Reorder selected columns with the ▲ ▼ buttons
- Drag column headers to resize widths
- All choices persist in your browser (localStorage)

**Available columns:** id, imdb\_id, tmdb\_id, title, year, release\_date, state, type, episode\_title, season\_number, episode\_number, airtime, collected\_at, version, content\_source, upgraded, early\_release, size

---

## Per-item actions

Each row has inline action buttons:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Delete (×)** | Remove item from the database. Optionally blacklist to prevent re-adding. |
| **Rescrape (↻)** | Delete and move back to the Wanted queue for a fresh scrape |

---

## Bulk operations

Select items using checkboxes. Use **Shift+click** to select a range. Then choose an action from the bulk action bar:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Delete Selected** | Remove all selected items. Optionally blacklist. |
| **Rescrape Selected** | Move all selected back to Wanted |
| **Move to Queue** | Move all selected to a specific queue state |
| **Change Version** | Apply a different quality profile to all selected |
| **Early Release** | Flag selected items for early-release handling |
| **Force Priority** | Mark items to jump to the front of the queue |
| **Resync Selected** | Resync symlinks and database paths for selected items |
| **Verify Symlinks** | Add selected items to the symlink verification queue |

!!! tip "Select across all pages"
    After clicking **Select All**, a **Select all N matching** button appears to select every item matching the current filter — not just the visible page.

Bulk operations are batched (450 items per batch) to avoid database lock issues.

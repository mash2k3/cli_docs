## API Call Summary

Shows aggregated counts of outgoing API calls to external services, grouped by time period.

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time Frame** | Hourly, Daily, or Monthly |
| **Update** | Refresh the table after changing the time frame |

The table shows one row per time period and one column per domain (api.trakt.tv, api.real-debrid.com, api.github.com, etc.) with call counts. Useful for monitoring rate limit usage and quota consumption.

---

## Real-time API Calls

A live feed of every outgoing API call, updating approximately every second.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Timestamp** | When the call was initiated |
| **Domain** | Base URL of the service (e.g. `api.trakt.tv`) |
| **Endpoint** | Specific path called (e.g. `/users/settings`) |
| **Method** | HTTP verb — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| **Status Code** | Response code (200, 401, 429, 500, etc.) |

Filter by domain using the dropdown. Useful for low-level debugging of external service interactions.

## Reverse Parser

Configures the default version assigned to releases when the parser cannot automatically identify a version from the filename or metadata.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Default Version** | The version profile to assign as a fallback when parsing can't determine one automatically |

Configure this to ensure releases without clear version indicators still get assigned a sensible quality profile.

## Manual Blacklist

Manage a blacklist of media items by IMDb ID. Blacklisted items will not be re-added by content sources.

**Adding an item:**

1. Enter the IMDb ID (e.g. `tt1234567`)
2. Click **Add to Blacklist**

For TV shows, expand the row to see individual seasons — check/uncheck seasons to control which are blacklisted. Use **Shift+click** to select a range of seasons. Click **Save All Changes** to apply.

**Columns:** IMDb ID, Title, Year, Media Type, Seasons, Delete

---

## Trakt Friends

Authorise a friend's Trakt account so their watchlist can be used as a content source.

**Adding a friend:**

1. Ask your friend to create a Trakt API application at [trakt.tv/oauth/applications](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and share their **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
2. Enter those credentials and click **Start Authorization**
3. A code and verification URL appear — your friend visits the URL and enters the code
4. Authorization completes within 60 seconds — a countdown timer shows the remaining time

**Authorised friends list:** Shows friend name, Trakt username, and token expiry. Use **Refresh Token** to renew an expired token, or **Delete** to remove access.

---

## Plex User Tokens

Collect Plex authentication tokens from other users so their libraries or watchlists can be used as content sources.

**How it works:**

1. Click **Generate User Login Link**
2. A code and auth URL are generated
3. Send the link to the other user — they visit it and sign in to their Plex account
4. Once authorised, their username and token appear in the **Stored Tokens** list

Tokens are stored locally in a JSON file. The page polls every 5 seconds and times out after 5 minutes if the user doesn't complete auth.

!!! warning "Security"
    Anyone with a stored token has access to that user's Plex data. Ensure your server is properly secured.

## Symlink Tools

Manually create a symlink for a media file using custom metadata — useful for files that cli_debrid couldn't automatically match.

**How to use:**

1. Enter or browse to the **Source File Path**
2. Click **Validate File** to confirm it exists
3. Fill in: Title, Year, Media Type, Version, IMDb/TMDB ID (optional), Content Source
4. For TV episodes: Season Number, Episode Number, Episode Title (optional)
5. Click **Preview Symlink Path** to see the generated path before committing
6. Click **Create Symlink** to create it

The file browser lets you navigate your mount directories to find files. Media file extensions (`.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, etc.) are highlighted.

Current symlink settings (original files path and symlink base path) are shown at the top of the page.

---

## Metadata Debug

View, recreate, or delete metadata entries in the battery database for a specific item.

**How to use:**

1. Enter an IMDb ID (e.g. `tt1234567`)
2. Click **Fetch** to display the current metadata

**Actions:**

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| **Fetch** | Retrieve and display the current metadata entry |
| **Recreate** | Delete the existing entry and re-fetch fresh metadata from the source |
| **Delete** | Remove the metadata entry without re-fetching |

Results are displayed as formatted JSON blocks for Item, Metadata, and Seasons. Recreate and Delete require confirmation before executing.

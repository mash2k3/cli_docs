# Step 1 — Prerequisites

Before installing anything, sign up for the required services and gather your API keys. This takes 10–15 minutes and avoids stopping mid-install.

## Required services

### 1. Debrid service

A debrid service is a premium link provider that caches torrents in the cloud. cli_debrid uses it to stream content without downloading locally.

You need **one** of the following:

| Service | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com) | Most popular, largest cache |
| [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com) | Good alternative |
| [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me) | Also supports Usenet |
| [Torbox](https://torbox.app) | Newer, growing cache |
| [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.com) | European provider |

!!! tip "Which one?"
    Real-Debrid has the largest torrent cache and is the most tested with cli_debrid. Start there if you're unsure.

After signing up, locate your API key:

=== "Real-Debrid"
    [real-debrid.com/apitoken](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken) — copy the token shown.

=== "AllDebrid"
    [alldebrid.com/apikeys](https://alldebrid.com/apikeys) — create a new API key.

=== "Premiumize"
    [premiumize.me/account](https://www.premiumize.me/account) — find **API Key** under your profile.

=== "Torbox"
    [torbox.app/settings](https://torbox.app/settings) — copy your API key.

=== "Debrid-Link"
    [debrid-link.com/webapp/apikey](https://debrid-link.com/webapp/apikey) — generate a key.

**Save this key — you will need it during cli_debrid setup.**

### 2. Media server

cli_debrid works with Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby. You need one installed and accessible on your network.

| Media server | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) | Most features supported. Plex Pass not required. |
| [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) | Free and open source. |
| [Emby](https://emby.media) | Supported via Jellyfin-compatible mode. |

!!! info "File management modes"
    cli_debrid has two file management modes that affect which media servers are supported:

    - **Plex mode** — uses the Plex API to manage your library. Plex only.
    - **Symlink mode** — creates symlinks on disk. Works with Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby.

You don't need to configure any libraries yet — that happens after the mount is set up. See the integration guides for setup instructions: [Plex](../integrations/plex.md) · [Jellyfin](../integrations/jellyfin.md)
